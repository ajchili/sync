## how to contribute
#### setup
1. `npm install -g gulp`
2. `npm install`
3. Select **Yes** or **Automatic** (roughly 4 questions about installing semantic are asked) for semantic and install to `semantic/`
4. `cd semantic`
5. `gulp build`
6. Develop!

#### developing
1. Due to our use of Firebase, access to data is currently not avaliable to a developer until a meaningful Pull Request is made by a developer.
2. With this in mind, using your own Firebase project for development is possible and permitted, however, any code written for any sync version must be written for the public domain (following MIT licensing).
3. Push your code, create a Pull Request, become a contributor!
