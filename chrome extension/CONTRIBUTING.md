## how to contribute
#### disclaimer
1. This version of sync is an active extension within the Chrome Web Store, thus distributing your own version of this version may be extremely problimatic. It's extremely recommended to create an issue or develop your suggested changes within this version.

#### developing
1. Due to our use of Firebase, access to data is currently not avaliable to a developer until a meaningful Pull Request is made by a developer.
2. With this in mind, using your own Firebase project for development is possible and permitted, however, any code written for any sync version must be written for the public domain (following MIT licensing).
3. Push your code, create a Pull Request, become a contributor!
